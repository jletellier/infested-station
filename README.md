# Infested Station

This short game was made during [Game Off 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021), a game jam "where participants spend the month of November creating games based on a secret theme". This year's theme was "BUG".

## Third-Party Assets

I am not allowed to redistribute most of the assets in the "external_resources" folder, so they are not included in this repository. However, if you like the sprites, I encourage you to buy/donate to the following assets and support the artists:

- Big thanks to [LimeZu](https://limezu.itch.io/) for his amazing [Modern Interiors](https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors) and [Modern Office](https://limezu.itch.io/modernoffice) asset packs! The majority of sprites are from there (with minor modifications).
- Also thanks to [Shubibubi](https://shubibubi.itch.io/) for the ladybug asset from [100 Nature Things](https://shubibubi.itch.io/nature-things).
- Some item sprites are from this [RPG 16x16 Items + Icons Pack](https://michael-zone-games.itch.io/rpg-16x16-items-icons) by [Michael Zone Games](https://michael-zone-games.itch.io/).
- The font is [m5x7](https://managore.itch.io/m5x7) by [Daniel Linssen](https://managore.itch.io/) and it's public domain (CC-0).
